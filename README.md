# Back-end-Project

Description of the application:
This application is a clothing application that aims to give the clothes we no longer use to people who are looking for them. There are obviously already applications that allow us to sell our clothes that we don't wear anymore, but I didn't want money to be the center of my project, and I wanted users to be able to help each other, and even exchange clothes.
For the moment, my application only contains an index page that allows you to access all the options that are currently present, that is to create a garment, modify your clothes, access the list of all the clothes that we have created and of course the possibility to delete them.
In the future, I would like to be able to make my application more beautiful in terms of visuals, because I have not had time to create a real visual, and to be able to make users see the clothes that other users have posted.
The potential biggest problem with this app is obviously the lack of payment, which makes it unattractive, because you need basic users to be able to attract others.

How to use my application:
In the index, the main page, the user can choose which cation he wants to perform.
If he wants to create a garment, he will just have to enter each characteristic of the garment to create it. If he does not enter anything, his attribute will be empty.
If you want to modify a garment, first you have to enter the name of the garment you want to modify in the first box, then you can enter each of its attributes. As in the case of creation, if he does not enter anything for an attribute, it will still be modified, and its characteristic will be empty.
If he wants to delete a garment, he just has to enter the name of the garment he wants to delete, just like for the modification.
And finally he can see the list of all the clothes he has created.

Its development:
I initially had a lot of trouble with the creation of this application, as I've never done a back-end before. That's why I didn't have time to take care of the aesthetic aspect of the application yet. But I learned quickly, and with the documentations I could find on the internet I could quickly assimilate the basics and be able to do what was necessary to create an application that respects the minimum requirements.
